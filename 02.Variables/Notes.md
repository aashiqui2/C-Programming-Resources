## What is a variable in C?
A variable in C is a memory location with some name that helps store some form of data and retrieves it when required. We can store different types of data in the variable and reuse the same variable for storing some other data any number of times.

```C Variable Syntax
data_type variable_name = value;    // defining single variable
            or
data_type variable_name1, variable_name2;    // defining multiple variable



Here,

data_type: Type of data that a variable can store.
variable_name:  Name of the variable given by the user.
value:  value assigned to the variable by the user.

Example:
int var;    // integer variable
char a;     // character variable
float fff;  // float variables

Important:
[C is a strongly typed language so all the variables types must be specified before using them.]


There are 3 aspects of defining a variable:

1.Variable Declaration
2.Variable Definition
3.Variable Initialization


C Variable Types
The C variables can be classified into the following types:

1.Local Variables
2.Global Variables
3.Static Variables
4.Automatic Variables
5.Extern Variables
6.Register Variables
```
