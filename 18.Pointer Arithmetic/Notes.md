1. addition of integer or increment
2. subtraction of integer or decrement
3. subtraction of one pointer from another pointer(same type)
4. we can apply all the relational operators
5. we can only perform + and - only.

    
1. Increment/Decrement of a Pointer
2. Addition of integer to a pointer
3. Subtraction of integer to a pointer
4. Subtracting two pointers of the same type
5. Comparison of pointers


# Comparision of pointers
We can compare the two pointers by using the comparison operators in C. We can implement this by using all operators in C >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=.  It returns true for the valid condition and returns false for the unsatisfied condition. 

`Step 1:` Initialize the integer values and point these integer values to the pointer.

`Step 2:` Now, check the condition by using comparison or relational operators on pointer variables.

`Step 3:` Display the output.
