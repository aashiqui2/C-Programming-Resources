* The full form of ASCII is the American Standard Code for information interchange. 
* It is a character encoding scheme used for electronics communication.
 Each character or a special character is represented by some ASCII code, and each ascii code occupies 7 bits in memory.

* In C programming language, a character variable does not contain a character value itself rather the ascii value of the character variable. 
* The ascii value represents the character variable in numbers, and each character variable is assigned with some number range from 0 to 127. For example, the ascii value of 'A' is 65.
